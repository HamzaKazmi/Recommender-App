# Recommender-App

Welcome to my App. 

I call it the Mood App, as it it made with the goal to help users maximize their time utility and make sure they are always in a happy mood.

Rate your daily activities, and get satification reports, activity recomendations, and machine learning recommendation on weather you should continue doing an activity or replace it with a different activity to maximize you time utility.

Logitic Regressio Model -  Takes in user activity rating and compares it with your other activities to decide weathr you should continue this activity or not.

SVD Algorithm -  Using user to user similarities andcollaborative filtering to recommend new actvities of intrest. Lets user discover new activities they would normaly not try.

KNNwithMeans Algorithm - Using item to item similarities to help users pick from multiple activities. User inputs activities they want to choose from and it uses their current activity data to recommend the best activity match.

D3.JS - Get reports on which activities have been making you feel the best etc.

Backend, and machine learing models are full completed and are posted in git.

Still working on completing front end.
